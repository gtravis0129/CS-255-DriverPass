CS 255 – Systems Analysis and Design Portfolio Reflection

Project: DriverPass

Project Summary

The DriverPass project was created for a client named DriverPass, a company that wanted to improve how students prepare for driving tests. The client requested a web-based system that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, access online study materials, and track their progress. The system also needed to support instructors and administrators by allowing them to manage schedules, lesson content, and user accounts. The goal of the system was to increase student pass rates by providing structured training and consistent access to learning resources.

What I Did Particularly Well

One area I believe I did particularly well was translating the client’s needs into clear and organized documentation. In the business requirements document, I focused on identifying functional and nonfunctional requirements that directly reflected what the client described. In the system design document, I created UML diagrams that showed how users would interact with the system and how the system components would work together. These diagrams helped clearly communicate the system’s structure and behavior.

What I Would Revise or Improve

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the level of detail in some of the UML diagrams. While the diagrams accurately represent the system, I would refine them by adding more specific edge cases and alternative flows. This would help make the design even clearer for developers who might use the document to implement the system in the future.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript and identifying key problems the client wanted to solve. These needs were then translated into system requirements and design elements, such as role-based access for students, instructors, and administrators. Considering the user’s needs is critical because the system must be usable and effective for the people who rely on it. A system that does not align with user expectations can fail even if it is technically correct.

My Approach to Software Design

When designing software, I start by understanding the problem from the user’s perspective before thinking about technical solutions. I use techniques such as requirement analysis, use case development, and UML modeling to break down the system into manageable components. In the future, I will continue using structured documentation, diagrams, and iterative review to ensure that designs remain aligned with both user needs and business goals.
